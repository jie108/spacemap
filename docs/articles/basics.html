<p>This vignette will help users become familiar with the implementation of the model parameters and the output associated with the <a href="https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/reference/spacemap.html">spacemap</a> function, which is the fundamental model fitting function of the R package. Familiarity with the mathematical expression of the spaceMap model will help the reader map the notation to R object variables (see the Methods section of the spacemap publication).</p>
</div>
<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#background" class="anchor"></a>Background</h2>
<p>The spaceMap model is a conditional graphical model suited for learning networks from high-dimensional data constrained by limited sample size. Two distinct data types are input to the model; one data type labeled as <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s are predictor variables that can be continuous, discrete, or categorical in nature; another data type is labeled as <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>’s and are continuous response variables. When we fit the spaceMap model, we seek to learn the network comprised of node set <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{V}= (X,Y)\)</span> and edge set <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{E}= \{ x_p - y_q : p \in \{1, \dots, P\}, q \in \{1, \dots, Q\} \} \cup \{ y_q - y_l : q \neq l \in \{1, \dots, Q\} \}\)</span>. The output of the model is the network containing the edges <span class="math inline">\(x-y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y-y\)</span>, but not <span class="math inline">\(x-x\)</span> edges. Motivated by integrative genomics applications, it has been applied to learn how genomic copy number alterations (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s) regulate protein expression co-variation (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>’s) in breast cancer. In this specific application, it learned <span class="math inline">\(x-y\)</span> edges to identify which genomic alterations disrupt which protein pathways, while simultaneously accounting for the <span class="math inline">\(y-y\)</span> interactions among the proteins in dysregulated cancer pathways. The model can be applied in a general sense to diverse high dimensional data types, not just those pertaining to integrative genomics.</p>

<a href="#example" class="anchor"></a>Example</h2>
<p>The simulation <a href="https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/reference/sim1.html">sim1</a> illustrates how to fit spaceMap. The simulation contains <span class="math inline">\(N=150\)</span> iid samples of <span class="math inline">\(P=14\)</span> predictor variables <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q=171\)</span> response variables <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> generated under a Gaussian Graphical Model; that is to say, $ (X,Y) N_{P + Q}(0,^{-1})$, where the non-zero elements of the inverse covariance matrix <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> specify edges between <span class="math inline">\(x-y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y-y\)</span> and (and <span class="math inline">\(x-x\)</span>, although these are ignored in the conditional framework). Normality is not a required model assumption for either predictor or response, but is useful for simulations because edges are easily parameterized through <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span>. In this case, we parameterized the network to have 4 prominent <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> hubs perturbing between 13 and 14 <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> variables, and two prominent <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> hubs. More details of the simulation and how to access the data and true network topology can be found in the <a href="https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/reference/sim1.html">sim1</a> documentation. We load the <code>sim1</code> R object, containing the <span class="math inline">\(N\times Q\)</span> response matrix <span class="math inline">\(\bf Y\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(N\times P\)</span> response matrix <span class="math inline">\(\bf X\)</span>, and the the true edges of the network.</p>

<a href="#tuning-penalties" class="anchor"></a>Tuning penalties</h3>
<p>Tuning penalties <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1, \lambda_2\)</span> correspond to parameters <code>lam1</code> and <code>lam2</code>, where each determines the degree of overall sparsity of the <span class="math inline">\(y-y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x-y\)</span> edges in the network, respectively. Tuning penalty <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_3\)</span> corresponds to parameter <code>lam3</code> and encourages selection of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> hubs–that is <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s that influence many <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>’s. The selection of appropriate penalty parameters is of primary importance when evaluating <code>spacemap::spacemap</code> to learn a network. In this simplified scenario we set the tuning parameters based on previous cross validation results. The task of selecting appropriate tuning parameters requires a robust model-selection routine and is discussed in more advanced vignettes.</p>

<div id="quick-visualization" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#quick-visualization" class="anchor"></a>Quick Visualization</h2>
<p>Network analysis is enhanced through visualizing the network topology. There are many external software libraries dedicated to visualization. We recommend using Cytoscape (not part of R) for publication quality visualizations. However, such a tool may involve some manual curation and the sophisticated options makes for a steeper learning curve. If you simply need a quick way to visualize the network output, the following section illustrates how to do so within R.</p>
<p>First, export the the spacemap output to an igraph object.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(igraph)
ig &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>spacemap::<span class="kw"><a href="../reference/adj2igraph.html">adj2igraph</a></span>(<span class="dt">yy =</span> adjnet$yy, <span class="dt">xy =</span> adjnet$xy)</code></pre></div>
<p>The igraph object <code>ig</code> has a very convenient sparse representation, with <code>ig</code> occupying 9 times smaller memory than <code>adjnet</code>. Many powerful network analysis tools are available in the igraph R package that enhance the visualization. For example, we identify modules or communities of the spaceMap network with igraph’s edge-betweenness algorithm.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">ceb &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>igraph::<span class="kw">cluster_edge_betweenness</span>(<span class="dt">graph =</span> ig)
members &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>igraph::<span class="kw">membership</span>(ceb)</code></pre></div>
<p>Color the nodes according to their communities. Since the community detection method we used was hierarchical, we can further group higher-order structure of the communities with shaded polygons. Edges between communities are colored red and edges within communities are colored in black. Nodes with higher degree are scaled to be larger.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">dg &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">degree</span>(ig)*<span class="fl">1.5</span>
<span class="kw">plot</span>(ceb, ig, <span class="dt">vertex.label=</span> <span class="st">""</span>, <span class="dt">vertex.size =</span> dg,
<span class="dt">edge.width =</span> <span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="kw">ecount</span>(ig)))</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="basics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672"></p>
<p>For interactive visualization, we may make use of the <code>networkD3</code> package. The following snippet will visualize <code>spacemap</code>’s network where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> hub nodes are larger in size. Colors denote the 14 different modules of the network. Hover over a node with your mouse if you wish to see the node ID and its adjacent neighbors.</p>
