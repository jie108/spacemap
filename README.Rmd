## Description

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/topherconley/spacemap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/topherconley/spacemap)

The spaceMap R package constructs _de novo_ networks from multiple data types in a high-dimensional context by applying a novel conditional graphical model. spaceMap is motivated by applications in integrative genomics, where two (or more) -omic data profiles are modeled jointly to discover their interactions. spaceMap is particularly effective in learning networks that exhibit hub topology. In an application to breast cancer tumor data, spaceMap learned regulatory networks which generated novel hypotheses of cancer drivers and confirmed known risk factors. In addition to learning network structure, an accompanying network analysis toolkit is also provided. The toolkit has been developed with genomics applications in mind---but may be adapted for other applications ---and maps scientic domain knowledge onto networks. The flowchart below provides an overview of how to fit spaceMap, perform network analysis in an integrative genomic context, and visualize important network signatures.

The spaceMap analysis pipeline is illustrated  through the analysis of [The Breast Cancer Proteogomics Landscape Study data](https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptac/s/S029), which is hosted on the GitHub repository [neta-bcpls](https://topherconley.github.io/neta-bcpls/). 


## Installation

The R package `spacemap` is available from GitHub. Please see the [most recent beta release](https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/installation.html) for installation. 


## Details 

### Learning robust networks

We built model selection and model aggregation tools into spaceMap for learning robust networks.  High throughput -omic experiments often have small sample sizes and the signal-to-noise can be low.  Models applied to such data can be prone to over-fitting and high variability. By a procedure called *CV.Vote*, one can learn model tuning parameters that balance the trade-off between power and false discovery rate (FDR). *CV.Vote* reports a network where edges must be present in a majority of networks fit under the training sets. Please see [Model Tuning](https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/articles/tuning.html) under the Vignettes tab for an example. Specific usage details of *CV.Vote* are documented in the function [cvVote](https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/reference/cvVote.html). 

Over-fitting can be further mitigated through bootstrap aggregation---called *Boot.Vote*---especially when sample size relative to dimensionality is a real concern. This procedure learns an ensemble of networks built on bootstrap replicates of data under CV-selected tuning parameters. Only the edges with majority representation among these networks are reported in the final network. Please see [Boostrap Ensemble Network] (https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/articles/ensemble.html) under the Vignettes tab for an example.
Specific usage details of *Boot.Vote* are documented in the functions [bootEnsemble](https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/reference/bootEnsemble.html) and [bootVote](https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/reference/bootVote.html). 

### Simulations

Several simulation experiments have been used to evaluate spaceMap in learning networks with prominent hub topology---a commonly encountered feature of biological networks. The GitHub repository [sim-spacemap](https://github.com/topherconley/sim-spacemap) contains codes of these simulations featuring: 

- simulation of hub network topology
- data generation according to a given network topology
- fitting of spaceMap and other graphical models to the data
- evaluation of fitted networks relative to true network topology

Documentation of these simulation codes will be forthcoming.

### Network analysis toolkit

Once a network has been learned, interpretation can be challenging. Thus, we included a _network analysis toolkit_ as part of the spaceMap analysis pipeline to facilitate network interpretation with special focus on integrative genomic applications. With user supplied annotation of nodes (e.g. gene coordinates, functional description), this toolkit enables:

- identification of cis/trans regulatory relationship
- prioritization of hub nodes 
- module analysis
- functional enrichment analysis (GO/KEGG)

All these features  are reported through structured tables and are easily incorporated into technical reports in a variety of formats. Moreover, the network analysis tool kit integrates the results into a network file (e.g. `.graphml` format) that can be exported  to existing tools such as the [Cytoscape ecosystem](http://www.cytoscape.org/what_is_cytoscape.html). In this sense, spaceMap is not just a model; rather it is a tool for deriving meaning from integrative genomics data. 

This toolkit is illustrated by [network analysis toolkit] (https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap/articles/neta.html) under the Vignettes tab.
