Description: The spaceMap R package constructs de novo networks from 
    heterogeneous data types in a high-dimensional context by applying a
    novel conditional graphical model. The underlying statistical model 
    is motivated by applications in integrative genomics, where two (or more) 
    -omic data profiles are modeled jointly to discover their interactions. 
    spaceMap is particularly effective in learning networks in diverse 
    applications that exhibit hub topology. In an application to breast
    cancer tumor data, spaceMap learned regulatory networks which generated 
    novel hypotheses of cancer drivers and confirmed known risk factors. 
    In addition to learning network structure, an accompanying network 
    analysis toolkit is provided. The toolkit has been developed with 
    genomics in mind---but can be adapted for other applications---and 
    maps scientic domain knowledge onto networks.
